High speed Matchport firmware installation instructions: 1. Download and save new Matchport test firmware from http://www.surveyor.com/blackfin/matchport-6500GE.rom 2. Upload new Matchport firmware via tftp - see http://www.surveyor.com/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1202655400 if you're uncertain how 3.  Download and save new SRV-1 Blackfin test firmware, as discussed here -http://www.surveyor.com/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1209425137Make certain to first upload the 921k version of firmware, not the 2500k version.  To use the ldr-c or ldr-lisp scripts, you should copy srv1-c.ldr.921k to srv1-c.ldr and copy srv1-lisp.ldr.921k to srv1-lisp.ldr 4.  Upload the new srv1-c.ldr or srv1-lisp.ldr to the SRV-1 via XMODEM, and save to flash with zZ.  Reboot the SRV-1 (shorting pins 1-2 of header block J1) to connect to the SRV-1 via telnet, nc or your favorite net terminal program to confirm that the new version of firmware is loaded. 5.  Via the net terminal connection, type 'h' - this will switch the firmware from 921k to 2500k baud.  This is temporary - if you reboot the SRV-1, you will be back to 921k.  Once the SRV-1 is set to 2500k, you will probably only get garbage characters via your net terminal connection until the Matchport baud rate is changed. 6.  now telnet to your Matchport on port 9999 to change its configuration.  If your IP address is 192.168.0.15, then   "telnet 192.168.0.15 9999" Press Enter for Setup Mode Change Setup:  0 Server  1 Channel 1  2 Channel 2  3 E-mail  4 WLAN  5 Expert  6 Security  7 Defaults  8 Exit without save  9 Save and exit            Your choice ?    First, select 5 Expertfor CPU performance, enter FFfor clk?, enter 81change MTU Size from 1400 to 1024skip the rest of the options Next, select 1 Channel 1  for Baudrate, enter -1for divisor, enter 2further down, for FlushMode, enter 80for Pack Cntrl, enter C0for InterCh Time, enter 3skip the rest of the options Finally, select 9 Save and exit 7.  Your Matchport should now be running at 2500k.  You may have to restart the telnet, nc, or net terminal connection to port 10001 after the change of baud rate, as the connection might have been broken.  Verify that the SRV-1 is running properly at this higher baud rate - try SRV1Console or any other test program you might have. 8.  Note that if you restart the SRV-1, it will return to 921k, and you will have to change the Matchport serial settings to 921k.  However, if you are running solidly at 2500k, then take the final step of uploading srv1-c.ldr.2500k or srv1-lisp.ldr-2500k via XMODEM.  After you reboot, the SRV-1 will be set to 2500k, you won't have to make any more changes. 9.  Special note - if you are compiling your own version of firmware, pay special attention to what baud rate has been set for UART0 in config.h.
